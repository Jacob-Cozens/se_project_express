# Project: What to Wear? (Backend)

### Overview

This is the backend code for a project called "WTWR". In this project, I've created a database and connected it to the server. In order for this to work, schemas were made for user information and clothing item information. Then, using routes and controllers, I've made it possible to add, change, and delete data from the database. There is also a big focus on error handling.
